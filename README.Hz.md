## FluidSynth for Hz

The idea is we'd like to deliver fluidsynth.clap with Hz.
The webview branch holds Hz-specific gui which isn't
generally useful outside the Hz context.

### Built Notes

* need to create and populate _prebuilt (depends on platform)
* need to ensure that sf2/default.sf2 is present.
